### How to embrace a growth mindset

1. Be self-aware
2. Strive for progress, not perfection
3. Learn from others

### Growth mindset

mental attitude that our basic abilities can be developed with dedication and hard work

When you have a growth mindset and you make a mistake or perform poorly, you consider the situation an opportunity for learning and development.

Understanding that there will always be people with lesser and greater abilities than yourself, you can avoid comparing yourself to others.

If someone in your peer group or a mentor experiences success, you might be able to learn new skills from that person directly.

“we can learn anything what we do not yet know”

“mistakes mean I’m learning”

“Given hard work, I can develop whatever skills I want”

### Fixed mindset

mental attitude that our basic abilities like intelligence and talent are fixed traits

New situations reveal what your abilities are. Each situation becomes a test that reveals the skills that you were born with based on how you perform.

Having a fixed mindset also means that you seek validation and approval from others. Because of that mindset, you might cling to what you're already good at and avoid risk and spontaneity.

“someone else can do better than me”

“I can be only good at certain things”

”what if people think I’m unintelligent”
