    2. 사람들이 잘 모르는 유용한 정보를 저장했다가 나중에 다시 찾아서 공유하는 모습을 보여주는 광고

    - [서브레딧](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/)
        
        A subreddit is a specific online community, and the posts associated with it, on the social media website Reddit. Subreddits are dedicated to a particular topic that people write about, and they're denoted by /r/, followed by the subreddit's name, e.g., /r/gaming
        
        Subreddits are notated as /r/subreddit name. Each subreddit acts as its own forum. Users log onto Reddit and receive a news feed from the subreddits they’re subscribed to. 
        
        To create your own *subreddit*, or “community” as Reddit calls them, you click on the button on the website that says *Create your own subreddit.* There are rules to make sure you are an active user before you can create a *subreddit.* 
        
        One notable subreddit is a subreddit for helping you find subreddits on a topic you find interesting: /r/findareddit

    ## Notion
    
    ### Focus on users needs
    
    mission: Give non-techies the ability to make their own tools without writing code. They wanted people to customize technology to solve their own problems. Ivan and Simon made a programming application that was easy to use even if someone didn’t know how to code. It turned out, people weren’t interested in that.
    
    “We focused too much on what we wanted to bring to the world,” Ivan put it. “We needed to pay attention to what the world wanted from us.” In March of 2018, after months of sleepless nights, Notion 1.0 was ready for primetime. In short stead, it [skyrocketed](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-1-0-web-mac-app)
     to the top of Product Hunt, [got a glowing review](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-only-app-you-need-for-work-life-productivity-1521640800) in the print version of the Wall Street Journal, and became famous for something else — [ignoring the door](https://www.businessinsider.com/notion-has-vc-knocking-on-its-doors-to-invest-2019-2)  when VCs came knocking.

    Notion’s growth has not been the result of large marketing budgets utilizing paid social, search, or display advertising but rather through its value to the community it fosters. Following the Product Hunt launch of Notion 2.0 in 2018, Notion saw a huge amount of traffic and an uptick in users. The widespread support and the Reddit community (45K strong) rallied behind all the features Notion has to offer. They simply used the traction they got from their community that already loves their product.
    
    Much of Notion’s success can be credited to its vibrant community of users and enthusiasts. Notion’s focus on community-led growth supported their unique product that is entirely user-driven. 
    
    During the start-up phase. they developed their content as their community provided them feedback. They focused on the quality of their content and making it a platform a smaller audience loved.
